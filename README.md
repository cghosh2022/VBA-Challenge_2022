# VBA-Challenge_2022

# Description
We used VBA script to loop through all the stocks for one year (each worksheet) and output the following information:

1.The ticker symbol
2.Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3.The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4.The total stock volume of the stock.
5.We also added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red for the Yearly change column.

VBA script was enabled to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once
